BASICS

4. What argument/switch option, when used with man, will search the short descriptions and man-page-names for a keyword that you provide?
man -k

5. Search the man pages for the keyword digest. Then, use one of the binaries listed to hash the string OneWayBestWay using the largest sha hash available.
man -k digest
echo -n "OneWayBestWay" | sha512sum

6. This file contains encrypted contents. Identify its file type, then decode its contents.
file Encrypted - is a zip
unzip Encrypted
cat symmetric - has key
openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -salt -in cipher -out newfile.txt
cat newfile.txt

HIERARCHY


6. What is the absolute path for the binary cat man-page?
whereis cat
/usr/share/man/man1/cat.1.gz

7. Search the user home directories to find the file with the second-most lines in it. Hint: Exclude the VDI file! The flag is the number of lines in the file.
wc -l <filename>

USERS AND GROUPS

1. Read the file that contains the user database for the machine. Identify a strange comment.
cat /etc/passwd

2. Identify all members of the lodge group. List their names in alphabetical order with a comma in between each name.
cat /etc/group | grep "lodge"

3. Find the user with a unique login shell.
sort /etc/passwd | uniq -c

PERMISSIONS

1. Find the directory named Bibliotheca. Enter the absolute path to the directory.
cd through filesystem to find

2. Identify the number of users with valid login shells, who can list the contents of the Bibliotheca directory.
ls to see permissions
for valid login shells grep -Ff /etc/shells /etc/passwd

3. The permissions that user sejanus has on /media/Bibliotheca, in octal format.
id sejanus - see what groups he is in
ls -l of Bibliotheca - see group for the file
Same group = same permissions

4. Locate the file within /media/Bibliotheca that is modifiable by the only user that is part of the Chapter group, but not part of the Lodge group.
cat /etc/group | grep "chapter
cat /etc/group | grep "lodge"
-find user who doesn't match
ls through files to find one where he has w

8. Execute the file owned by the guardsmen group in /media/Bibliotheca, as the owning user.
find file and cat

9. Read the concealed file within /media/Bibliotheca
ls -l -d .?* for only hidden files or ls -la to show everything plus hidden

10. Find the warp and read its secrets for the flag.
find -type f -name ".*" | grep secret

REFORMAT

1. Use awk to print lines:

>= 420 AND <=1337

The flag is a SHA512 hash of the output.
awk 'NR>=420&&NR<=1337' numbers | sha512sum

2.
awk -F' ' -v OFS="," '{print $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6}' connections > file.csv
for first line add space after separator and add comma to the end

LOGIC

1. Minefield map
