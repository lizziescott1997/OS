process validity- making sure things are what they say they are

DLL- dynamically linked list, used to run executables
Service- started up on boot or when user logs in, runs in background completing a task

Possible abnormal things in process list?
  mispelled processes to obfuscate
  known system processes w/ extremely high PID
  DLLs/modules from weird/specific location
  patterns in ephemeral ports

get-process smss,csrss,lsass | sort -property id - see just these three processes; discover normal, abnormal, and hidden processes and services

get-process chrome | foreach {$a} {$_.modules} - see DLLs (modules) for Chrome
  DLLs in user's downloads folder likely malicious

get-process | select name,id,description | sort -property id - see processes w/ only name,id,descrption sorted by PID
  -look for missing descriptions

Get-Process | Select Name, Id, Path | sort -property id
  -look for abnormal locations in path for normal processes

Get-Ciminstance Win32_service | Select Name, Processid, Pathname - see services and their path

get-nettcpconnection
get-nettcpconnection -state established - see all established network connections
**ephemeral ports 1024-65535 - used for duration of communication session, pseudorandom
  -look for ports like 3333, 4444(metasploit), other odd patterns

get-scheduledtask | select * | select -first 3 - see info on first 3 scheduled tasks

CMD COMMANDS

tasklist /v | more - windows cmd way to see processes
  -supposed to be run under user NT Authority so look for regular username(abnormal)
tasklist /svc - see services hosted under each process
tasklist /m | more - see processes and their DLLS
    tasklist /m /fi "imagename eq chrome.exe" | more - see DLLs for chrome specifically
      /fi - filter

sc query - view services in cmd
sc queryex type=service | more - get more detailed list
sc queryex type=service state=inactive - only see inactive services

schtasks /query | more - see scheduled tasks in cmd

netstat -anob - get network connections
