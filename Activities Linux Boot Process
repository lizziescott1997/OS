4, 8

2. How many bits does a single Hexadecimal character represent?
4

3. How many bytes could the range 0x00000000 - 0x00000010 contain?
17

4. What are the values contained in hex positions 0x00000001 through 0x00000008?

MBR

1. How large is the Master Boot Record and what directory is it located in?
512, /dev

2. Locate the master boot record for one of the Linux machines and read it with xxd
What programming language is the MBR written in?
sudo xxd -l 512 -g 1 /dev/vda
assembly

3. The file /home/bombadil/mbroken is a copy of an MBR from another machine. Hash only the Bootstrap section of the MBR using md5sum. The flag is the entire hash.
dd if=mbroken bs=1 skip=446 count=16

4. The file /home/bombadil/mbroken is a copy of an MBR from another machine.
Hash the first partition of the file using md5sum. The flag is the hash.

dd if=mbroken bs=446 count=1


5. The file /home/bombadil/mbroken is a copy of an MBR from another machine.
You will find the "word" GRUB in the output, hash using md5sum.

generated hash of word GRUB

SYSV

1. 
Identify which of your Linux machines is using SysV Initialization.

SYSTEMD

1. Identify the file symbolically-linked to init on the SystemD init machine.
ls -l /sbin/init
/lib/systemd/systemd

2. What is the default target on the SystemD machine and where is it actually located?
ls -lisa /lib/systemd/system/default.target
graphical.target, /lib/systemd/system/graphical.target

3. What unit does the graphical.target want to start, based solely on its configuration file?
cat /lib/systemd/system/default.target
wants=display-manager.service

4. What dependency to graphical.target will stop it from executing if it fails to start, based solely on its static configuration file?
same as 3
requires=multi-user.target

5. How many wants dependencies does SystemD actually recognize for the default.target
ls -l /etc/systemd/system
saw default.target.wants
cd to that directory
cat file inside
# of options under [unit]

6. What is the full path to the binary used for standard message logging?
/usr/sbin/rsyslogd

GRUB 

1. Identify the Linux Kernel being loaded by the Grub, by examining its configuration.
linux is command
find file path w/ cat /proc/cmdline
