PROCESSES

1. What is the process ID (PID) of the SysV Init daemon?
1

2. How many child processes did SysV Init daemon spawn?
20
ps -elf look for PPID of 1

3. Identify all of the arguments given to the ntpd daemon (service) using ps.
ps -elf | grep ntpd

4. What is the parent process to Bombadilâ€™s Bash process? (name of the binary, not the absolute path)
ps -elf, find ppid of bash and look for that pid to get parent

5. Identify the file mapped to the fourth file descriptor (handle) of the cron process.
sudo lsof | more
look for cron, kept trying file paths (happened to be last one)

6. Identify the permissions that cron has on the file identified in Processes 5.
read,write (guessed)

7. Identify the names of the orphan processes on the SysV system.
look at htop, add PPID, look for files that appear and then PPID changes to 1

8. Locate zombie processes on the SysV system.
Identify the zombie processes' parent process.
/bin/funk
find zombie process w/ ps aux | grep Z
htop, tree view(press f5)

9. Locate the strange open port on the SysV system.
Identify the command line executable and its arguments.
find strange port w/ netstat
sudo lsof -i :9999 finds command
look at htop to see command w/arguments

10. Locate the strange open port on the SysV system.
Identify how the process persists between reboots.
The flag is the absolute path for the file that contains the persistence mechanism, and the configuration option.
cat /etc/inittab
look for strange entry (netcat stuff)

PROC DIR

1. Examine the process list to find the ssh process. Then, identify the symbolic link to the absolute path for its executable in the /proc directory.
ps aux | grep sshd - find pid for /usr/sbin/sshd
sudo ls -l /proc/1999 - exe -> /usr/sbin/sshd
/proc/1999/exe,/usr/sbin/sshd

2. Identify the file that contains udp connection information. Identify the process using port 123.
For the flag, enter:
    Process name
    File descriptor number for the udp socket
    Its permissions as shown in lsof

netstat -ano - find open port
sudo lsof -i :123
look through entries for answer (ntpd, 18, u)

3. Identify one of the human-readable file handles by the other program that creates a zombie process.
-other zombie is thenine, cat it, find /opt/mysoul
go there, cat that for flag

FIND EVIL

1. Scenario: The Villains group has been chanting offerings to their new leader at regular intervals over a TCP connection.
Task: Identify their method of communication and how it is occurring. Locate the following artifacts: ** The chant/text used by each villain (include spaces) 
** The new Lord receiving the offering ** The IP address and port that the offering is received over
sudo ls -lisa /var/spool/cron/crontabs - see a bunch of users
go to Azogs home directory and dir - find chants doc, cat it
htop, look for netcat command to find new lord and ip/port
