                                              MEMORY


Volatile Memory:
    Non-persistent
    Requires power to maintain the stored information; it retains its contents while powered on but when the power is interrupted, the stored data is immediately lost
        RAM

Non-Volatile Memory:
    Persistent
    Does not require a continuous power supply to retain the data stored in a computing device
        HDD
        USB

Data that has not been stored on disk yet is present in memory
  -processes, commands, Bash history file
Files that have been deleted or modified can be scraped from RAM and used as evidence or for timelining an attack
EX:
    Bash history is written to .bash_history once the terminal session is terminated, 
    however each command that has been ran during the current terminal session resides in RAM and can be viewed using the bash plugin
    If the ~/.bash_history has been deleted, using the same method as above we can still retrieve all commands executed
    Logs that have been deleted or modified can be read and scraped from memory using the mfind mcat & mls plugins

MEMORY ANALYSIS

Analyzing a system’s RAM to determine information about running programs, the operating system, and the overall state of a computer

                                VOLATILITY

  Memory Analysis framework
  Volatility provides cross-platform solutions on Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux
  Each operating system has its own memory acquisition tool called Persistent Memory (pmem)
        Linpmem
        Winpmem
        OSXpmem

Order of Volatility - half life of data
    1. CPU registers, cache
    2. Routing table, ARP cache, process table, kernel stats, memory
    3. Temporary file systems
    4. Disk
    5. Remote logging and monitoring data
    6. Physical configuration, network topology
    7. Archival media - backups

Volatility Version             Pros                              Cons

Python                    updated frequently                lengthy install
                          all profiles available            can't run w/o python install

Standalaone               no installation necessary        not all profiles included
                          quick & easy to download/run     not updated frequently
                          can run w/o python

        PROFILES AND PROFILE SELECTION CREATION

A Profile provides Volatility with a memory layout based on the kernel of the machine upon which it’s created. 
   ensures Volatility is able to parse the memory image appropriately and return expected data when given a command

Volatility hosts a profile repository with most known Windows builds; however, their Linux profile selection is lacking
    Cloning the repository to a local machine is possible for offline analysis needs

                                VOLATILITY DEMO

CASE SENSITIVE

cd C:\Users\andy.dwyer\Desktop\Memory_Analysis
.\volatlility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe
.\volatlility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" imageinfo - determine Profile from suggested profile, instantiated
.\volatlility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 -h - see commands w/ profile
  .\volatlility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 pslist - output of process list at time system dumped into memory file
      -look for anything abnormal, strange exes, etc.
      pslist).count - get number of processes
  \volatlility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 psscan - similar to pslist
pstree - get PIDs

Dump a process:
Virus and threat protection, turn off real time protection
\volatlility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 procdump -p <PID> -D .
get-filehash .\<result from process dump>
search hash on VirusTotal

Memory Dump:
\volatlility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 memdump -p <PID> -D .
  -end up w/ .dmp in dir
  -open w /strings: 
    net use * \\live.sysinternals.com\tools
`   cd C:\sysinternalssuite\
    .\strings.exe -accepteula C:\Users\andy.dwyer\desktop\memory_analysis\<>.dmp > C:\users\andy.dwyer\desktop\memory_analysis\<>.txt
  -open in notepad++
    look for network connections: find, regular expression, IP regex, find all in current document
    \volatlility_2.6_win64_standalone.exe -f ".\cridex.vmem" --profile=WinXPSP2x86 connections - see connections for that specific profile
        can also use connscan
